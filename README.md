- [koa](https://koajs.com/) : Next generation web framework for node.js with **28.1K** stars on [[giihub](https://github.com/koajs/koa)]
    
    <table><tr><td bgcolor=gray>
    Expressive HTTP middleware framework for node.js to make web applications and APIs more enjoyable to write. Koa's middleware stack flows in a stack-like manner, allowing you to perform actions downstream then filter and manipulate the response upstream.<br></br>

    Only methods that are common to nearly all HTTP servers are integrated directly into Koa's small ~570 SLOC codebase. This includes things like content negotiation, normalization of node inconsistencies, redirection, and a few others.

    Koa is not bundled with any middleware.

- [nest](https://nestjs.com/) : A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable and scalable server-side applications with **22.3K** stars on [[github](https://github.com/nestjs/nest)]

    <table><tr><td bgcolor=gray>
    Nest is a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications. It uses modern JavaScript, is built with TypeScript (preserves compatibility with pure JavaScript) and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).<br></br>

    Under the hood, Nest makes use of Express, but also, provides compatibility with a wide range of other libraries, like e.g. Fastify, allowing for easy use of the myriad third-party plugins which are available.

- [fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) : Fast and low overhead web framework for Node.js with **12.9K** stars on [[github](https://github.com/fastify/fastify)]

    <table><tr><td bgcolor=gray>
    An efficient server implies a lower cost of the infrastructure, a better responsiveness under load and happy users. How can you efficiently handle the resources of your server, knowing that you are serving the highest number of requests as possible, without sacrificing security validations and handy development?<br></br>

    Enter Fastify. Fastify is a web framework highly focused on providing the best developer experience with the least overhead and a powerful plugin architecture. It is inspired by Hapi and Express and as far as we know, it is one of the fastest web frameworks in town.
