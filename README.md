- [Rxjx](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/) : Reactive Extensions Library for JavaScript with **20.6K** stars on [[github](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs)]

    <table><tr><td bgcolor=gray>
    RxJS is a library for reactive programming using Observables, to make it easier to compose asynchronous or callback-based code. This project is a rewrite of Reactive-Extensions/RxJS with better performance, better modularity, better debuggable call stacks, while staying mostly backwards compatible, with some breaking changes that reduce the API surface

- [NgRx](https://ngrx.io/) : Reactive State for Angular with **5.5K** stars on [[github](https://github.com/ngrx/platform)]

    <table><tr><td bgcolor=gray>
    NgRx Store provides reactive state management for Angular apps inspired by Redux. Unify the events in your application and derive state using RxJS<br></br>

    NgRx Effects gives you a framework for isolating side effects from your components by connecting observables of actions to your store

    NgRx Schematics helps you avoid writing common boilerplate and instead focus on building your application

**Backend**

- [express](https://expressjs.com/) : Fast, unopinionated, minimalist webframework for Node.js with **46.5K** stars on [[github](https://github.com/expressjs/express)] 
    
    <table><tr><td bgcolor=gray>
    Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
    </td></tr></table>

- [koa](https://koajs.com/) : Next generation web framework for node.js with **28.1K** stars on [[giihub](https://github.com/koajs/koa)]
    
    <table><tr><td bgcolor=gray>
    Expressive HTTP middleware framework for node.js to make web applications and APIs more enjoyable to write. Koa's middleware stack flows in a stack-like manner, allowing you to perform actions downstream then filter and manipulate the response upstream.<br></br>

    Only methods that are common to nearly all HTTP servers are integrated directly into Koa's small ~570 SLOC codebase. This includes things like content negotiation, normalization of node inconsistencies, redirection, and a few others.

    Koa is not bundled with any middleware.

- [nest](https://nestjs.com/) : A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable and scalable server-side applications with **22.3K** stars on [[github](https://github.com/nestjs/nest)]

    <table><tr><td bgcolor=gray>
    Nest is a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications. It uses modern JavaScript, is built with TypeScript (preserves compatibility with pure JavaScript) and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).<br></br>

    Under the hood, Nest makes use of Express, but also, provides compatibility with a wide range of other libraries, like e.g. Fastify, allowing for easy use of the myriad third-party plugins which are available.
    </td></tr></table>
    
- [fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) : Fast and low overhead web framework for Node.js with **12.9K** stars on [[github](https://github.com/fastify/fastify)]

    <table><tr><td bgcolor=gray>
    An efficient server implies a lower cost of the infrastructure, a better responsiveness under load and happy users. How can you efficiently handle the resources of your server, knowing that you are serving the highest number of requests as possible, without sacrificing security validations and handy development?<br></br>

    Enter Fastify. Fastify is a web framework highly focused on providing the best developer experience with the least overhead and a powerful plugin architecture. It is inspired by Hapi and Express and as far as we know, it is one of the fastest web frameworks in town.
